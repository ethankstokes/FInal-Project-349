        <p>Here are my projects:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Project A — During my internship I worked on reconsilling and automating the FR2004AB report. This is an important report the federal government requires banks to send. The current proccess was manual and required the RSG team to find the missing positions with excel. I developed a new excel formula that would sort the positions to show what was missing automatically and this was implemented into our system to make the process smoother.</li>
          <li>Project B — Pictured below is an experience prototype I built in my MI420 prototyping class. This is an idea for reducing traffic on campus to install a cross campus gondola called the Spartan Skyway. There would be stops all throughout campus making it easy to get from end to end quickly. This would reduce the need to drive to class and less poeple would be on the road or cramping up all the parrking lots.</li>
        </ul>
